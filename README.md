# Running MPI Applications on Ice-X (LIneA)

## 1) Access the machine loginicx
The server loginicx is the frontend for the Cluster ICE-X and it is not accessible direct from the internet. Go to devel2 and then login to loginicx machine. 

`ssh loginicx`

## 2) Setup the environment (EUPS)
Once you are into the loginicx machine then you need to setup the environment, open the file ~/.bashrc and put the lines below.
. /mnt/eups/linea_eups_setup.sh
setup openmpi

Reload the file running this command:
```
source ~/.bashrc
```

## 3) Compiling your MPI application

mpicc hello_world_with_mpi.c -o hello_world_with_mpi

## 4) Create the file machines
Create (or copy) a file called "machines", put the names of the nodes where you want to run your application. Make sure your application is running stable before occupy all nodes.
NODES: r1i0n0, r1i0n1, r1i1n0, r1i1n1
```
$ condor_status -master | cut -d ' ' -f1 | tail -n 4 > machines
```

## 5) Running your MPI application
To submit a job you can use one of the options below.

### 5.1) condor_run

```condor_run mpirun -machinefile machines -np 90 hello_world_with_mpi```

Understanding the executable above:


| Parameter | Description |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| condor_run      | to run with condor cluster system
| mpirun          | main mpi executable
| -v              | verbose, just to control what is happening |
| -x OPENMPI_DIR  | This is a must, you must set up this variable, ALWAYS |
| --prefix $OPENMPI_DIR  | This is a must, you must set up this prefix, ALWAYS |
| -np 4           | The number of cpus |
| -machinefile machines  | defining the file where you define which machines to use, do not forget to use only the resources that you need. |
| hello_world_with_mpi  | the mpi application |

### 5.2) condor_submit
Go to the directory where you mpi app lives and create a submit file and use the command condor_submit to send the job to the cluster. See the example below.
```
universe = vanilla
executable = /mnt/eups/packages/Linux64/openmpi/1.8.4+0/bin/mpirun
arguments = -machinefile machines -np 90 hello_world_with_mpi
should_transfer_files = yes
when_to_transfer_output = on_exit
transfer_input_files = monte_carlo_mpi,machines

error = condor.$(Process).err
output = condor.$(Process).out
log = condor.$(Process).log

queue
```
Submit the job
```condor_submit hello_world_with_mpi.submit```
